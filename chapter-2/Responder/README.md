#Chapter 2: Getting Started with RSocket

##Core concepts of the RSocket.

##Setting up a basic RSocket application : Hello World.

## Build the project 

We recommend a workstation with the following configurations for working with the repository:

| â„– | Name   | Value                                                       |
|---|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | JDK    | openjdk 11.0.14 or above                                    |
| 2 | OS     | Linux, MacOS (11.8.3 and above), Windows Vista SP2 and above |
| 3 | Network | No restriction                                              |
| 4 | RAM    | Minimum 4GB of RAM                                          |
| 5 | CPU    | Minimum 2 core                                              |
| 5 | IDE    | Eclipse, IntelliJ Idea, NetBeans or JDeveloper              |
| 6 | Gradle | Gradle 7.6                                                  |

Run the following command from the directory named **chapter-2**

```
./gradlew fatJar 
```
or (at these moments its works;-) )

```
./gradlew run 
```
Run the RSC client with the following command:

```
java -jar ./rsc-0.4.2.jar --debug --request --data "{\"origin\":\"Client\",\"interaction\":\"Request\"}" --route request-response tcp://localhost:7007 
```

##RSocket communication patterns by examples:
1. request/response;
2. fire-and-forget;
3. and streaming interactions.
